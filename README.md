# Advanced Hands-on Rust

Working through the advanced Rust [book](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwmrust/advanced-hands-on-rust/) by PragProg, currently in beta. Games make use of Bevy 0.12, but I have updated these examples to 0.14.

## Workspaces

All workspaces linked below:
| Workspace | Dir |
|:-|:-|
| Hello Bevy               | [link](./hello_bevy) |
| Flappy Dragon            | [link](./flappy)     |
| My Library               | [link](./my_library) |
| Pig (dice game)          | [link](./pig)        |

## Notes
1. Currently experiencing an issue where MenuAssets are not being loaded on startup, but only load at game over.
